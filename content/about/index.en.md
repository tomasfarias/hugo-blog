I'm Tom√°s, a Software Engineer that is looking to document some of my thoughts and, hopefully, help other people in the process. Knowing why I believe a blog should exist may give you an idea of the type of content you may find here; with that being said, I believe a blog exists to:
* Fill gaps in official documentation by providing practical examples.
* Raise awareness about a particular issue, topic, or tool.
* Serve as a source of inspiration by showcasing projects.

In the process of achieving these objectives, I will ramble about programming languages, like Python and Rust, the ecosystem surrounding those languages, Emacs, open-source tools and software, Linux, Software Engineering practices, and probably many others.

If you wish to get in contact with me, you may do so via my projects at [GitHub](https://github.com/tomasfarias), through a message via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasfarias/) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3994693/tomas-farias), or by writing me an [email](mailto:tomas@tomasfarias.dev).

Thanks for checking out my blog!
